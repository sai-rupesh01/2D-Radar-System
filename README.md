# 2D Radar System 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **2D radar system** that scans the surrounding environment using an **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** mounted on a **servo motor**. The sensor collects distance data at different angles, and the results are visualized on a graphical radar display using **Python & Processing**.

## 🎯 Features
- 📡 **Real-time object detection** using ultrasonic sensor
- 🔄 **180-degree scanning** using a servo motor
- 📊 **Graphical radar interface** To visualize detected objects
- 🔗 **Serial communication** between Arduino & PC

## 🛠️ Components Required
| Component         | Quantity |
|------------------|----------|
| Arduino Uno      | 1        |
| HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor | 1 |
| SG90 Servo Motor | 1 |
| Jumper Wires     | As needed |
| Breadboard       | 1 |
| PC with Python & Processing | 1 |

## 🚀 Usage
1. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the **Arduino code** to the microcontroller.
3. Run the **Python script** in Visual Studio to visualize the radar display.
4. Observe the detected objects in real time!
